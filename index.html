	    <h2>What she means to me</h2>
	    <p>Tama slid into my dms while we were both in form 2 and we've been building a friendship ever since. No matter where the winds of life take us I'd like to think we've created a sort of home in each other. A place to return to.She has my heart now, we've been dating for close to three months now, exactly three months on the 20th. In her arms is where I'm most comfortable. She's a great listener, she's understanding, she's kind. I love her<p>
