		<h2>What she's about</h2>

		<p>Tama's dedicated to making the world a better place. She wants to solve the world's problems. She's started two non-profits. One of them, the social impact project is dedicated to supplying under-priviledged school children with school supplies. The other, The Student project, it's getting off of the ground, is dedicated to being a platform through which those kept out of the mainstream education pipeline can acquire employable skills <br>
		Tama believes that equal opportunity should be granted to everyone regardless of their gender. She's outspoken on issues of gender-based violence and sexism
	    Tama represents the future of the African continent</p>

	    <h2>What she means to me</h2>
	    <p>Tama slid into my dms while we were both in form 2 and we've been building a friendship ever since. No matter where the winds of life take us I'd like to think we've created a sort of home in each other. A place to return to.She has my heart now, we've been dating for close to three months now, exactly three months on the 20th. In her arms is where I'm most comfortable. She's a great listener, she's understanding, she's kind. I love her<p>
